# implementing-and-evaluating-k_means-clusting-from-clustering
This program implements a custom K-Means algorithm to cluster data into groups by iteratively updating centroids and assigning points to the nearest one. It loads the Iris dataset, fits the model, evaluates clustering accuracy, and generates an ASCII scatter plot to visualize the resulting clusters.
